Migration Delivery Timeline
Start: Feb 3, 2026
End: July 31, 2026
Total Duration: ~6 months
Phase 1: Readiness & Feasibility
Feb 3 – Mar 6, 2026 (≈5 weeks)
Focus
Establish a realistic migration baseline
Eliminate false assumptions early
Key Outcomes
Representative analysis of Informatica workflows
Platform JSON expressiveness comparison
Classified inventory:
Straightforward migrations
Manual / custom cases
Unsupported patterns
Decision Gate (Early March)
Confirm feasible migration scope
Approve move into platform validation
Phase 2: Platform Validation
Mar 9 – Apr 3, 2026 (≈4 weeks)
Focus
Prove that valid definitions produce working pipelines
Key Outcomes
Deployed JSONs validated via control‑plane APIs
Confirmed DAG creation and execution behavior
Identified runtime gaps and constraints
Decision Gate (Early April)
Confirm platform behavior is sufficiently understood
Agree on known constraints entering migration design
Phase 3: Automation & Migration Design
Apr 6 – May 8, 2026 (≈5 weeks)
Focus
Apply automation selectively and safely
Key Outcomes
Defined automation boundaries and guardrails
Expected automation coverage percentage
Explicit manual exception strategy
Migration execution playbook
Decision Gate (Mid‑May)
Approve automation scope
Authorize scaled execution
Phase 4: Scaled Migration Execution
May 11 – July 31, 2026 (≈11 weeks)
Focus
Predictable delivery at scale with controlled risk
Key Activities
Prioritize workflows by complexity
Apply validated automation
Handle exceptions deliberately
Continuous validation and feedback loops
Key Outcomes
Phased migration completion
Reduced operational surprises
Stable, supportable target‑platform pipelines
