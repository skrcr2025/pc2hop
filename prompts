In the current working directory, We have 2 excel files placed. Where one file with name consolidated have the mapping information (Detailed_Analysis sheet), and other sheet All_BUs have the WF names and its associated mappings (basically WF to mapping relationship) along with other columns as well. Now i need to generate a new sheet by referencing two of  these sheets and have these columns in the new sheet repository_name, folder_name, Workflow_name, mapping_name, source_count, target_count, transformation_types, data_flow_pattern ( filter and just pick 'Simple' , this column is in consolidated - excel) - and WF_Run_History ( filter WF_RUN_COUNT_LAST_365D from All_BUs sheet, and ignore all entries with 0 value here)
