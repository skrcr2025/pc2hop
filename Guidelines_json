Datastore, Connection and Dataset
Guidelines

Datastore
A datastore is logical name of a database or filesystem. It would entail the host details of the datastore.
The datastore has to be registered first.
Datastore name should be unique.

Datastore Connection
A connection is logical name for the connection. The connection name would remain the same irrespective of the environments. 
Datastore connection should be associated with a registered datastore.
Connection name should be unique.
Password and user name will be stored in secrets manager or equivalent facility managed by BU application teams.
Connection would contain the connection name and the physical spec of the datastore. For filesystem it would only have connection name.

Dataset
A dataset defines the definition of the data itself. It can be a file or table or kafka topic. It describes the where - datastore that holds the data , the what - what is the dataset layout and if the dataset object is not physically defined(function as a table but by joining multiple tables) then what query that defines this dataset.
Dataset name should be unique
Dataset name follows a 3 part notation - datastore_name.schema_name.dataset_name or datastore_name.folder_name.dataset_name. The notion of the folder name will be further refined to maintain consistent naming structure.


Json Formats

Approach 1: To separate the API call for datastore/connection and datastore/connection detail. Also provide only the details of the env which needs change.
Challenges - Multiple hierarchy of API calls for developers.
Approach 2: Combine Json for datastore/connection and datastore/connection detail. Provide the entire json payload for all envs for any change. Approach 2 is used for defining the datastore/connection and dataset.
Challenges  - Forcing a single API call to provide entire payload can result in overriding existing connection details.
